The Engineering Vibration Toolbox

Overview
==========

The Engineering Vibration  Toolbox is a set of over 35 educational
programs and associated files by `Joseph C.
Slater <http://josephcslater.github.io>`__.
It can be run on any platform supported by
`Matlab <http://www.mathworks.com/>`__ or
`Octave <http://www.octave.org>`__  (Mac, Windows, VMS, Unix, Cygwin). Also
included are help files, examples, and files containing raw
experimental data. The codes include single degree of freedom
response, response spectrum, finite elements, numerical integration,
modal analysis and phase plane analysis. It is included free with
the text "Engineering Vibration" by `Prof. Daniel J. Inman <http://www.engin.umich.edu/college/about/people/profiles/f-to-j/daniel-inman>`__ (`Prentice
Hall <http://www.prenhall.com>`__).

I highly recommend use of
`Octave <http://www.octave.org>`__ or Python if possible, as they are free. If you know `Matlab <http://www.mathworks.com/>`__, you already
know most of `Octave <http://www.octave.org>`__. Most students will hardly know the difference,
except that it's free! The *Octavized*
toolbox can be found `here <ovtoolbox>`__. Further, the licensing is
less restrictive (no charge for professional use!). The entire archive
can be `downloaded as a zip file <https://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/ovtoolbox/archive/master.zip>`__. Please
refer to the `Octave web site <http://www.octave.org>`__ for details on obtaining and installing
`Octave <http://www.octave.org>`__.

If you are new to vibration, you can learn about what vibration is and why it's important at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Structural Dynamics Technical Committee `Exploring Structural Dynamics website <www.exploringstructuraldynamics.org>`__.
